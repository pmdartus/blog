Hi! I am Pierre-Marie Dartus, software engineer based out of Paris, France.

Currently working at Salesforce on the UI platform, I create tools and frameworks for developers to build the next generation of web applications on the Salesforce platform.

I primarily work on the web platform and JavaScript runtimes APIs, developer tooling, and performance optimizations. Web standard and open source enthusiast, I am a W3C representative and maintainer of [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom).
